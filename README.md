This project was aimed to design a mini-drone using an Arduino nano that can be controlled by bluetooth through an Android phone

Although the motors were able to start, the current delivered to motors was mostly wasted on the L293D (H-bridge)

I was suggested to use MOSFETS instead of the L293D, however I needed to design a PCB to solder my components since the MOSFETS came in a packaging that can't be wired to a breadboard. So I decided to postpone this project since I didn't have the PCB design skills back then.

Self-Leveling Drone
#
This project will be a full size self-leveling drone which will be controlled by a RC transmitter, however this project will be finished after the self-balancing robot since I will gain more experience regarding self-balancing vehicles.
